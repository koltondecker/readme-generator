## Description: 
Any good project also needs and utilizes a good readme file. It can be tedious to go through the work to format and build a readme every time you build a project. That's where this readme generator comes in. Using node.js and command line input, a user can follow command line prompts to input necessary information to populate a professional looking readme in minutes. 

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer">Inquirer</a> was used for this project.
